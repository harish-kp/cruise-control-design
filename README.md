# Cruise Controller design
Prerequisite knowledge - MATLab, Control systems
This repository deals with the controller design for cruise control of a car in MATLab and Simulink.
The Cruise control is one of the most used control systems in automobile industry to ensure the safety of the vehicle and cruise at any desired speed that can be achieved by a given vehicle. This repository and report (U6366102_Design_project_report.pdf) discusses the design of controllers for an average car, Audi A4 2.0 TDI, and BMW 520d. 
The necessity of cruise control is to improve the driving experience, reduce fatigue, and advance the overall efficiency of the car. There are various techniques to attain a desirable solution for this problem. This report focuses on PD, PID based cruise controller design and Fuzzy P based controller design. The document also analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each of the controllers and modelling of each of the above-mentioned cars and the performance of each of the controller in various scenarios that are experienced on roads.
